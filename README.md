# Google Apps Script

Google Apps Script to automate and customise Google Apps such as Forms, Sheets etc.

1. Seperate Google Form Response files in different folders.
    If you have a Google Form with file upload and you want your files to automatically be sorted into sepcific folder based on response. You can use [this script](FormToFolder.gs). This script is written for the following example. 

    ![FormToFolder](images/form1.png)

    You can add more complex operations to categorize files.
